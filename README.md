# Git for DevOps

This repository is used to practice and document Git commands
from my perspective.

## Purpose
- Daily Git practice
- Understanding real Git workflows
- Building strong fundamentals for DevOps roles

## Structure
- git_commands.txt → Git commands with explanation
- test.py → Sample file to practice commits and changes

## Note
This is a practice repository, not a production project.
